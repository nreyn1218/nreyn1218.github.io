			<h3><a href = "https://www.nfl.com/"> NFL</a></h3>
			<p>This is the official website of the National Football League. The website is very well designed and everything is very easily accessible. There are links and pages for nearly every piece of information you could want about football and what's going on in the league.</p>
			<p>CRAP Principles:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Contrast</li>
				<li>Repetition</li>
				<li>Alignment</li>
				<li>Proximity</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Contrast: The NFL's website follows the CRAP principles of contrast because the entire site is very readable and even when there is text on images the contrast helps the visibility and doesn't make the reader struggle.Their contrast with font sizes also helps the reader determine titles and the text related with them.</p>
			<p>Repetition: The repetition principle is on display on the NFL's website because they stick with about 3 colors across the entirety of the website except for the colors associated with individual teams. The entire site gives off a sense of uniformity and wouldn't be confused for separate information or a separate website.</p>
			<p>Alignment: This website utilizes alignment very well as it is very organized and displays a menu across the top of the page with all of the other pages that contain more specific information.</p>
			<p>Proximity: Proximity can be seen on this site because things such as the menu across the top is separated from the rest of the page where different news stories and links are separated enough to be distinguished as different. There is a lot going on on this webpage and yet the reader should have no problem distinguishing what is what.</p>

			<h4><a href = "https://arngren.net/"> Arngren</a></h4>
			<p>This is a Norwegian website that lists all kinds of vehicles and their prices. The website is very unorganized and poorly designed. It is extremely cluttered and there's too much going on. </p>
			<p>CRAP Principles:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Contrast</li>
				<li>Repetition</li>
				<li>Alignment</li>
				<li>Proximity</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Contrast: This website executes the contrast principle very poorly. There are different colors all over the place and letters and numbers are even overlapping each other. Although this page is Norwegian and everything is in a different format/currency, I know that this website is very poorly put together.</p>
			<p>Repetition: The repetition principle is almost entirely absent from this page. There are different colors all across the page. They don't seem to stick to a color scheme and everything seems to just be thrown together with no sense of uniformity.</p>
			<p>Alignment: Arngren has no sense of alignment whatsoever. The images are all different sizes and most of them are too small to even make out. There are pictres and text that are off-centered and overlapping and it displays a very poor example of alignment.</p>
			<p>Proximity: Everything on the Arngren site is too close to each other and it is hard to determine what is what on the page. There's too much information and postings/listings on the main page for anybody to know what is going on.</p>
