			<h2>What is "Overlanding"?</h2>
			<p>Overlanding is actually a specific type of traveling that is beginning to take the country by storm. It can be seen below in the picture of our Toyota Tundra that we have outfitted with gear that is made all over the world so that you're able to essentially live out of your vehicle! Overlanding typically consists of having a "pop-up" tent installed on the roof of your vehicle so that you're able to sleep in a nice and comfortable bed anytime, anywhere! There are many different add-ons for vehicles that make it much more convenient to live out of such as things like a drop-down shower, portable grill, or a cover that encloses the entire back-end of the vehicle with a tent to have a private and secure area! Some of these things can be seen on our vehicle here!</p>

					<h3>How We Got Started</h3>
					<div>
                	<p>We've always dreamt of traveling the world after retiring from the military and we thought, "What better way to see our country than by doing it state by state?" Since then, we've found companies from all over that supply us with different pieces and parts that have allowed us to be able to live out of our truck.
						The process of getting our equipment took awhile along with actually installing it but ever since that has happened, we've had the ability to travel anywhere we could want! If you have any questions
						about how we got to where we are, please utilize our "Contact Us" page!

					<h3>Asheville Vehicle Outfitters</h3>
					<div>
                	<p>After seeing pictures of our vehicle, we often are asked where we went to even start modifying our vehicle the way we did. We feel it's only right to give this business credit 
						as they have been amazing at finding exactly what we need. <a href= "https://ashevillevehicleoutfitters.com/" target="_blank">Asheville Vehicle Outfitters</a> have done everything they possibly can and more to
					 	"outfit" our truck with all of the equipment seen above. From a refrigerator and freezer, to a shower, to solar panels, to a literal tent on top of our truck, they have done it all. If you're seriously interested in converting your vehicle so that you're able to overland yourself, definitely consider them! They service people from all over the country!

			    	<h3>A Short Message From Us</h3>
					<div>
					<p>We know it's easier said than done but we wanted to make sure we put in a note here to you guys just simply stating that NOW is the time to travel. We know that people have obligations, routines, things to take care of to be able to maintain the life you have but we feel that it is so important to make the time to explore the world. It doesn't have to be a flight to Europe or a cruise to islands; something as simple as visiting your neighboring state or even city. There's so much out there in the world and 
						we truly believe that if people forced themselves to set aside time to explore and see new things, the world would be a much happier place. <br><br> - Leatherneck Overland
