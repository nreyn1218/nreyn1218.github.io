            <p>Project Overview:</p>
			<ul class="left">
				<li>My application is going to be a website for my parents who are avid travelers that have started their own YouTube channel to document their trips. They are doing a lot to be able to put out content of their vacations and the process for their viewers and it's inspiring. The purpose of this site is to organize all of their content into one cohesive space and to display it well.</li>
				<li>The intended users of this website are people that are interested in traveling to the places that my parents have visited or learning about overlanding in general</li>
				<li>The content of this website will be a collection of my parents videos and pictures from their travels, an about page that will tell the users a history of how my parents got to where they are, a background on overlanding, the equipment they use and the upgrades they've made to their vehicle that allow for their unique style of traveling, as well as their itineraries from their trips.</li>
			</ul>

            <h5>Dynamic Functionality on the Website:</h5>
            <p>I will implement a photo gallery on the home page that will display images from my clients' trips around the globe as a way to draw the user in. I also plan on including a form for the user to fill out on the Contact Us page that will allow the user to send a message to Leatherneck Overland and choose a topic from a dropdown menu. I feel that this is will be a very informational site for their brand and allow the user to really undersatnd what their brand is, who they are, the equipment they use, and an ability to reach out to them for several different options.</p>
