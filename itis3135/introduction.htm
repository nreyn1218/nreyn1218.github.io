        <ul>
            <li>Personal background: Grew up in a military family so I've moved all over. I was born in Honolulu, HI, moved to Tampa, Florida, then up and down the coast of California for 8 years and now here in NC. I've been in CLT for about 4 years now and this is the longest I've lived in one place.</li>
            <li>Professional: I've only had 3 jobs since turning 15 years old. I worked at a burger place in Wilmington, NC called Hwy 55, then Food Lion for a bit, and now I'm currently at Inizio Pizza Napoletana in Huntersville while I'm in school. I can't wait to actually start my professional career.</li>
            <li>Academic background: I came into college with the intention of double majoring in Psychology and Criminal Justice and was on track to finish with both this past spring but last summer I realized I didn't want to work in those fields so I took up Computer Science and I should be graduating with my BA in Computer Science with a focus in IT.</li>
            <li>Background in the subject matter of this course: As of last Summer I didn't know anything about computers or coding so all of my knowledge is fairly new but I'm enjoying it and I love finding stuff that's applicabe to everyday life.</li>
            <li>Primary Computer Platform: Windows 7-10</li>
            <li>Courses I'm taking: 
                <ul>
                    <li>ENGL2116 - Intro to Technical Communication</li>
                    <li>ITCS3160 - Database Design and Implementation</li>
                    <li>ITIS3135 - Web App Design and Development</li>
                    <li>ITIS3200 - Intro to Information Security and Privacy</li>
                    <li>STAT2223 - Elements of Statistics II</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you by:
                When I lived in Palm Springs, CA there were a lot of Samoans that lived there and they would actually bring ukuleles to school. I thought it was cool and ended up buying one and teaching myself how to play on YouTube. I eventually got pretty good and started performing and making good money for it! And no, it's not like Over The Rainbow or simple songs. I can play Bohemian Rhapsody and songs on that level! </li>
            <li>I'd also like to share:
                I just went to Honolulu, HI in early July of this year and proposed to my girlfriend of 4 years! We have our wedding planned for next fall!</li>
        </ul>
